Please analyze this running session and provide the following:

1) A clear summary of the workout, including total distance, average pace, and heart rate.
2) A detailed evaluation of intervals or structured blocks (use the laps data!).
3) Key strengths and areas for improvement.
4) Specific, actionable training advice for the next session.
